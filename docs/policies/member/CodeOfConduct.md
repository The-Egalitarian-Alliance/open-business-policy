# Member Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This document sets forth the behavior expected of our members towards themselves, other individuals, our organization, and other organizations.

## Scope

These policies apply to all members regardless of role or responsibilities. These policies are included by reference in the Membership Agreement.

## Policies

### Compliance with the Law

All members are expected to comply with international, national, and local laws applicable to the jurisdictions in which they live and work. This includes, but is not limited to, all safety, environmental, consumer protection, and fair dealing laws. No policy, express or implied, permits any member to violate the law or refuse to comply with a legally issued order.

#### Cases

1. If a member feels that a request from an outside individual or organization may involve illegal behavior or is not legally issued they may contact our Legal department for advice at no cost to themselves.
2. In the event that a member is unable to engage our legal department for any reason they may engage a third party legal counsel of their choice. Once the matter is resolved, they may request reimbursement for any costs incurred.

### Ethical, Egalitarian, and Responsible

We expect all members to act in accordance with our mission, our guiding principles, and our ethical framework at all times. Every member is responsible for their choices and actions.

Members of our organization are discouraged from accepting gifts from clients or partners. Bribes for the benefit of any internal or external party are prohibited. If in doubt whether a gift is accepteble, members may contact our Legal department for advice at no cost to themselves.

### Dignity and Respect of Others

We believe that every individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. We do not allow any kind of degrading, dicriminatory, or harassing behavior.

### Protection of Property

All members should treat the property of our organization and others, whether material or intangible, with care and respect.

#### Cases

1. No member is expected to use their personal property for the benefit of the company. This includes personal communication devices, such as phones, and personal accounts, such as email.
2. Exceptions to this may be made with the agreement of both our organization and the member. In such cases appropriate compensation will be made to the member.
3. In cases where specific items are required, such as attire, we shall provide the items at no cost to the member. We shall also be responsible for repairs and replacement. Day to day care, such as cleaning and maintenance, are the responsibility of thee member. Reimbursement of costs associated with the care may be requested.

### Duties and Authority

All members should fulfill the duties they have accepted from our organization with integrity and respect. We expect members to follow their director's instructions and complete their duties with skill and quality and do so in a timely manner.

It is the duty of all directors in our organization to direct the work of their team, delegate appropriately, and support their team. We expect our directors to support the health and well being of their team above all else.

We support a communication first approach to resolving issues. No adverse action will be taken for a member sharing a challenge or grievance. Our directors are required to always seek an equitable resolution.

### Attendance

We expect our members to be punctual, arriving on time and adhering to schedules, as appropriate. In cases where this is not possible, we expect members to communicate to the coordinating director as soon as possible.

We expect our directors to work with members when scheduling and to accomodate the needs of our members as much as possible. Excessive, unapproved tardiness or absenteeism will be dealt with according to our Conflict Resolution Policies.

### Appearance

We fully support the uniqueness of our members, and as such we do not require uniforms, suits, or other formal attire outside of specific public facing roles.
