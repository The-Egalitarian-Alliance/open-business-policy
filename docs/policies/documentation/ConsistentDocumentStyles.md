# Consistent Document Styles

## Policy Statement

All documents MUST conform to the style guide(s), published separately.

## Rationale

Requiring strict adherence to the style guides ensures documents are tools for effective communication, reflect organizational values, and are a foundation for operational excellence.

### Inclusivity and Accessibility

The style guides include accessibility standards (e.g., plain language, proper use of headings, and alternative text for images). Enforcing adherence to these standards ensures documents are accessible to diverse audiences, including those with disabilities or non-native language speakers. They also improve the ability of assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to parse the content.

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance

In many industries, proper documentation is critical for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Following the style guides ensures documents meet these standards, reducing the risk of costly errors or omissions.

### Support for Evidence-Based Practices

A consistent style guide promotes clear referencing and documentation of sources, fostering a culture of evidence-based decision-making. Proper citation practices demonstrate transparency and credibility in all written materials.

### Improved Communication

Using a consistent writing style improves clarity and readability, reducing misunderstandings and ambiguities in written communication. Consistent terminology, formatting, and structure make documents easier to navigate and understand for all readers, including team members, clients, and regulatory bodies.

### Consistency and Professionalism

Adhering to a standardized style guide ensures uniformity across all documents, reflecting a professional and cohesive organizational image. This consistency builds trust with stakeholders by presenting a clear, organized, and credible brand identity.

### Efficiency in Collaboration

When all documents follow a shared style guide, collaboration becomes more efficient. Team members can quickly create, review, and edit documents without needing to guess formatting rules or rewrite sections for conformity. This reduces duplication of effort and streamlines workflows.

### Scalability and Adaptability

For organizations that grow or work across multiple teams and regions, a shared style guide ensures seamless integration of practices. It provides a foundation for adapting content to local or cultural needs while maintaining the core structure and tone.
