# Overview

These documents provides a set of ethical, evidence based, and open source business policies and procedures for any business to use. These policies are designed to enforce fairness, transparency, accountability, and social responsibility within any organization that adopts them. By integrating principles rooted in ethics and evidence, The Open Business Policy aims to create a sustainable, extendable framework that supports the health and well being of the people, the community, and the organization.

## Scope

These policies and procedures are intended to cover a wide range of organizations and organizational needs while remaining adaptable and scalable. They are structured to address common operational areas such as employee success, community engagement, stewardship, governance, risk management, financial practices, data security, and more.

## Identity and Legal Information

When implementing these policies and procedures an [Identification and Legal Information](core/identification-and-legal.md) page must be the first page or link. This page identifies the various entities that will be referred to throughout the documents, as well as providing a single source for basic legal information such as the identities of the officers of the organization. This allows the rest of the documents to use generic references, such as "the organization" instead of specific names for maximum reusability.

## About the Policies

### What is Included

- **Policy Statement**: A clear and concise summary of the guiding principle.
- **Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions to implement the policy in practice.
- **Monitoring**: Methods for tracking and tuning each policy.
- **Mitigation and Redress**: How to correct issues with compliance and ensure that everyone is treated fairly.
- **Evidence**: Details of the basis for the policy, including references, studies, standards, and other sources supporting the policy.
- **Cases**: Examples, cases, and implementation options for tailoring the policy to specific organizational needs.

### What is Not Included

- **Metrics**: While the policies do include information for monitoring and tuning, they do not include what are commonly known as "metrics".
- **Employee Rankings**: Each employee is evaluated individually and rewarded according to objective criteria. There are no comparisons between employees, no stack rankings, and no other subjective evaluations.
- **Employees ad Fungible Assets**: Employees are people, not parts. These policies actively avoid procedures that lead to cycles of hiring and firing. Instead, they are designed to build to a stable, sustainable staffing level.
- **Ivory Towers**: Any policy or procedure that creates adversarial divisions within the organization, such as competetive departmental budgeting, are avoided. Departments are designed to have clearly defined responsibilities, consistent engagement processes, and transparency.
- **Soup of the Day**: Every policy and procedure is designed to be flexible, tunable, and durable. Because every policy is evidence-based there are no fad patterns.
- **Inertial Approaches**: It doesn't matter how things have been done in the past if the evidence does not support it. These policies include what might be referred to as meta-policies, that is policies about maintaining the policies.
- **Policy for the Sake of Policy**: Every policy has a clear scope, purpose, and objective. Each policy includes methods for providing evidence to auditors.
- **Pseudo-evidence**: There are no unprovable claims, e.g. attestations without evidence.
